# Cucumber-Testing
This Project is about making tests with Cucumber. The following build presented here is about a Dentist appointment setup where it test different case scenarios like:
* Login
  * Making sure that all input fields are fulfilled.
    * If they are not it makes sure to tell the user to fill them.
  * Checking for correct input data.
    * If its correct it logs the user in saying "You logged in the system".
    * If its not it says "Wrong data".
* Appointment
  * Again making sure that all input fields are fulfilled.
    * If one of the fields isnt fulfilled then it prompts the user to fill it correctly.
      * The fields are: 
        * Name
        * Email
        * Date
        * Telephone Number
